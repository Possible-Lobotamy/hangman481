# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Milestone 1:
1. firstly the random package from python's inbuilt packages was imported. This allowed me to randomly chose and object from a data structure. I.e a list.
2. Then a list with 5 string objects, that represented 5 different fruits, was created.
3. This was then applied to the the 'random()' function to generate a random one of said string objects.
